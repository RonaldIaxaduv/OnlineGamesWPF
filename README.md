# OnlineGamesWPF
An implementation of Connect Four and Chomp using C# and WPF which can be played online (server required, e.g. Hamachi) or singleplayer, created as a university project in 2019.

Part of the implementation was a window where participants could chat before and while facing off in the games. Using WPF made the layouting quite satisfying for that window in particular.
