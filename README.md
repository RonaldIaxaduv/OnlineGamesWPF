# About
This is an implementation of Connect Four and Chomp using C# and WPF which can be played online (server required, e.g. Hamachi) or singleplayer, created as a university project in 2019.
Fair warning: in singleplayer mode, the opposing players are quite hard to beat (especially in Chomp).


# Connect Four
In Connect Four, players take turns throwing one playing stone down a column. Whoever manages to align four of their playing stones horizontally, vertically or diagonally, wins.

# Chomp
In Chomp, players take turns removing a rectangular area from a playing field. Whoever takes the last piece wins.

# Chat
Part of the implementation was a window where participants could chat before and while facing off in the games. Using WPF made the layouting quite satisfying for that window in particular.
